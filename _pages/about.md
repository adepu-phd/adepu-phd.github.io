I am a President Graduate Fellow in the Information Systems Technology and Design pillar at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) under the supervision of Professor [Aditya Mathur](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/faculty/apm.html), Professor [Jianying Zhou](http://jianying.space/). I am also part of [iTrust](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/), centre for research in cyber security, where I have been involving in multiple Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) security projects.
I got an opportunity to work with Professor [Eunsuk Kang](https://www.isri.cmu.edu/people/core-faculty/kang-eunsuk.html) and Professor [David Garlan](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~garlan/) in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) during my Ph.D. exchange program. During my stay at CMU, I was associated with [CyLab](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/) and [ABLE](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~able/). I received a Masters in Computer Science and Engineering from National Institute of Technology. 

Research Overview
======

My research interests are in the security of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), Industrial Control Systems and Critical Infrastructure. My research investigates  the  [cyber  physical  attack  models](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7552024), [impact  of  attacks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7423145), [detection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8486707) and  mitigation on CPS. My research takes a multidisciplinary approach to tackle the security issues associated with CPS which includescritical infrastructures such as water treatment,electrical power grid,autonomous vehicles, digital manufacturing, and Internet of Things.
