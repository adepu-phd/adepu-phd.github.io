I am a President Graduate Fellow in the Information Systems Technology and Design pillar at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) under the supervision of Professor [Aditya Mathur](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/faculty/apm.html), Professor [Jianying Zhou](http://jianying.space/). During the Ph.D., I worked on the Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) security at the iTrust Labs and testbeds in SUTD. I got an opportunity to work with Professor [Eunsuk Kang](https://www.isri.cmu.edu/people/core-faculty/kang-eunsuk.html) and Professor [David Garlan](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~garlan/) in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) during my Ph.D. exchange program. During my stay at CMU, I was associated with [CyLab](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/). I received a Masters in Computer Science and Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Rourkela.
