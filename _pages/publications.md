Impact:
======

My research efforts have led to high impact research outputs such as patents (x3, 1 pending), research publications (25+, 3x best paper awards, 890+ Citations), training deliveries (10+ to government agencies), workshops (4+) and teachings (100+ advanced students, Best Teaching Awards).



*  Operationalize the world’s  unique  cyber  security  testbeds  at  the  iTrust,  supported  by MINDEF  and  NRF  Singapore.  Testbeds include [water treatment](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs-home/itrust-labs_swat/), [water distribution](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs-home/itrust-labs_wadi/) and [smart grid](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs-home/itrust-labs_epic/).

* I was involved in designining innovative  curriculum  for  generating  cyber  security  leaders  through  university education. An example of this course [‘51.508’](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/courses/mssd/secure-cyber-physical-systems/) at SUTD designed for masters student of Security by Design where I co-developed the content  and lab  experiments to  train security  professionals.

* I  have designed  and organized  workshops for  government  agencies  such  as  [public  utility  board](https://www.pub.gov.sg/)  in Singapore on  CPS security to train them under smart nation initiative.

* To serve the broader research community, I have produced the first [dataset](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs_datasets/)  for  CPS  security  from  an  operational  real-time  CPS  which  is  downloaded  and  used  by  more  than  2000 researchers from more than 50 countries across the globe.

* Patents: [Distributed attack detection in ICS](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200311283A1/en), [Method of detecting cyber attacks](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200162482A1/en) and [Defense system and method against cyber-physical attacks](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20190253440A1/en).


* Organised and participated in world unique [security exercises](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/ciss-2019/) in industrial systems called CISS(Critical Infrastructure Security Showdown). So far event is organised in [2016](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/scy-phy-systems-week/2016/s3/), [2017](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/scy-phy-systems-week/2017-2/s317-event/), [2019](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/ciss-2019/), [2020](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/ciss-2020-ol/).  


* [Crossed Swords 2020](https://ccdcoe.org/news/2020/exercise-crossed-swords-2020-reached-new-levels-of-multinational-and-interdisciplinary-cooperation/): [iTrust@SUTD](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/news-events/news/crossed-swords-2020/) was invited to the 6th iteration of the annual cyber exercise Crossed Swords in Riga, Latvia which brought together more than 120 technical experts, Cyber Commands’ members, Special Forces operators and military police.
