Impact:
======

My research efforts have led to high impact research outputs such as patents (x3, 1 pending), research publications (25+, 3x best paper awards, 900+ Citations), training deliveries (10+ to government agencies), workshops (4+) and teachings (100+ advanced students, Best Teaching Awards)

* Patents: [Distributed attack detection in ICS](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200311283A1/en), [Method of detecting cyber attacks](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200162482A1/en) and [Defense system and method against cyber-physical attacks](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20190253440A1/en).

*  Operationalize the world’s  unique  cyber  security  testbeds  at  the  iTrust,  supported  by MINDEF  and  NRF  Singapore.  Testbeds include [water treatment](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs-home/itrust-labs_swat/), [water distribution](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs-home/itrust-labs_wadi/) and [smart grid](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs-home/itrust-labs_epic/).

* I have involved designining innovative  curriculum  for  generating  cyber  security  leaders  through  university education. An example of this course [‘51.508’](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/courses/mssd/secure-cyber-physical-systems/) at SUTD designed for masters student of Security by Design where I co-developed the content  and lab  experiments to  train security  professionals.

* I  have designed  and organized  workshops,for  government  agencies  such  as  public  utility  boards  in Singapore on  CPS security to train them under smart nation initiative.

* To serve the broader research community, I have produced the first [dataset](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs_datasets/)  for  CPS  security  from  an  operational  real-time  CPS  which  is  downloaded  and  used  by  more  than  2000 researchers from more than 50 research organizations across the globe.
